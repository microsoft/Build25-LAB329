    "# Registering Your Optimized Model to Azure ML\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to register your fine-tuned and optimized model to the Azure Machine Learning registry. Model registration is crucial for version tracking, sharing, and deploying models in a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to authenticate with Azure Machine Learning\n",
    "- How to create an ML client to interact with your Azure ML workspace\n",
    "- How to register model files to the Azure ML registry\n",
    "- How to add metadata and descriptions to your model\n",
    "- How to list and verify your registered models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completed the previous notebooks:\n",
    "  - `01.AzureML_Distillation.ipynb` (generated training data)\n",
    "  - `02.AzureML_FineTuningAndConvertByMSOlive.ipynb` (fine-tuned and optimized the model)\n",
    "  - `03.AzureML_RuningByORTGenAI.ipynb` (tested the optimized model)\n",
    "- Successfully created model files in `models/phi-4-mini/onnx/`\n",
