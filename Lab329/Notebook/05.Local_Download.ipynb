    "# Downloading Your Azure ML Model for Local Use\n",

    "\n",
    "- How to authenticate with Azure Machine Learning\n",
    "- How to connect to your Azure ML workspace\n",

    "  - `01.AzureML_Distillation.ipynb` (generated training data)\n",
    "  - `02.AzureML_FineTuningAndConvertByMSOlive.ipynb` (fine-tuned and optimized the model)\n",
    "  - `03.AzureML_RuningByORTGenAI.ipynb` (tested the optimized model)\n",
