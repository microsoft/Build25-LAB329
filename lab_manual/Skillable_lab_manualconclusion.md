# Conclusion

## What You've Learned

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the Model Distillation Workshop. Here's what you've accomplished:

1. **Generated training data** using a large teacher model (DeepSeek-V3)
2. **Fine-tuned a smaller student model** (Phi-4-mini) using LoRA
3. **Optimized the model** with ONNX conversion and int4 quantization
4. **Tested the model** using ONNX Runtime GenAI
5. **Registered the model** to Azure ML
6. **Downloaded and run the model locally**

You've learned:

- How knowledge distillation transfers intelligence from large to small models
- How to use Microsoft Olive for fine-tuning and optimization
- How to use ONNX Runtime GenAI for efficient inference
- How to deploy models locally for edge computing scenarios

## Next Steps

Here are some ways to build on what you've learned:

1. **Try different datasets**
   - Use different types of questions or tasks
   - Create your own custom dataset
2. **Explore different models**
   - Try different teacher models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
   - Try different student models (Phi-3, Llama, etc.)
3. **Optimize for different targets**
   - Try different quantization levels (int8, fp16)
   - Target different hardware (ARM, NVIDIA Jetson, etc.)
4. **Build applications**
   - Create a simple web UI for your model
   - Integrate it with other applications
5. **Learn more about:**
   - [Microsoft Olive](https://github.com/microsoft/Olive)
   - [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/)
   - [Azure ML](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning)

Thank you for participating in this workshop! Your feedback is valuable for improving future sessions.
