## Workshop Overview

Welcome to the Model Distillation Workshop! In this hands-on session, you'll learn how to transform a large language model (DeepSeek-V3) into a smaller, equally capable model (Phi-4-mini) using knowledge distillation.

## Scenario

**Scenario: Edge AI for Education — Efficient Question Answering on Resource-Constrained Devices**

Imagine you are an AI engineer at an EdTech company. Your goal is to deliver an intelligent question-answering assistant that can run on affordable, resource-constrained devices in schools, such as laptops or edge servers, without requiring constant cloud connectivity. However, the best-performing language models are large and expensive to run locally.

In this workshop, you will:
- Use a large, cloud-hosted language model (the "teacher") to generate high-quality answers for a multiple-choice question dataset (CommonsenseQA).
- Distill this knowledge into a much smaller, efficient "student" model (Phi-4-mini) using knowledge distillation and fine-tuning techniques.
- Optimize and quantize the student model (using Microsoft Olive and ONNX) so it can run efficiently on local hardware.
- Register, download, and deploy the optimized model to an edge device using Azure AI Foundry Local.
- Validate that your compact model can answer questions with high accuracy and low latency, even on limited hardware.

This scenario reflects real-world needs for deploying AI in education, healthcare, manufacturing, and other sectors where cost, privacy, and offline capability are critical. By the end of the lab, you will have built an end-to-end workflow for distilling, optimizing, and deploying advanced AI models from the cloud to the edge.

### What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you'll create a compact language model that:
- Is **75% smaller** than the original teacher model
- Runs on **standard hardware** without specialized GPUs
- Can be deployed on **edge devices** or embedded systems
- Maintains most of the **capabilities** of the larger model

<!-- ### Workshop Flow

This is a **practical, code-first workshop**. You'll work through six Jupyter notebooks that guide you step-by-step through:

1. **Data Generation**: Create training examples using a large "teacher" model
2. **Fine-Tuning**: Train a smaller "student" model on this data
3. **Optimization**: Convert and compress the model for efficiency
4. **Testing**: Verify the model works correctly
5. **Registration**: Register your model with Azure ML
6. **Deployment**: Download and run the model locally

Each notebook is designed to be completed in 5-15 minutes, with clear instructions at each step. -->


> **Important:** This workshop uses Azure ML Studio and requires access to a deployed Azure AI model endpoint. You should have already been provided with the necessary credentials.

## Environment Setup

Let's start by setting up your environment and cloning the code repository to your Azure Machine Learning Workspace.

### 1. Access Azure ML Studio

Open Azure ML Studio by:
1. Go to Azure ML Studio +++https://ml.azure.com+++
2. Sign in with your Azure credentials
3. Select your workspace (provided by your instructor)
4. Navigate to the "Notebooks" section

Let's start with the first notebook!

## Clone the GitHub Repo and resources to your Azure ML Studio 

Open your Azure ML Studio +++https://ml.azure.com+++

![MLStudio](./images/ML_Studio.png)

Select Notebooks

![MLStudioNotebooks](./images/Notebook_Terminal.png)

Select Terminal

![SelectTerminal](./images/ML_Terminal.png)

2. To clone the repository and set up your environment for the lab, follow these steps in the terminal:

```
cd Users &&
      cd User1-* &&
      git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Build25-LAB329 &&
      cd Build25-LAB329
```

Press the refresh icon on your notebooks panel. You should now see your Build25-Lab329 folder within your users folder.

3. Upload your local.env file. We have a provided 'local.env' file in the lab folder on the desktop of the VM. We need to upload this to the noetbooks environment. Using Azure ML Studio UI https://ml.azure.com to the users folder 


- Open Azure ML Studio.
- Navigate to Notebooks in your workspace.
- Click on the Upload button.
- Select the file from your local system and upload the local.env file into the root of the users home folder within user.

Ensure the TEACHER_MODEL_ENDPOINT is correct including/models
TEACHER_MODEL_ENDPOINT="https://westus3.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/
Update to be:
TEACHER_MODEL_ENDPOINT="https://westus3.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/models 

4. **Navigate to the Lab Directory**: Go to the Lab329 folder containing the notebooks:

```
Build-Lab329/Lab329/Notebook
```

## Notebook-by-Notebook Guide

This workshop uses 7 Jupyter notebooks that you'll run in sequence. Each notebook builds on the previous one, so it's important to complete them in order. We will be your Azure ML workspace Notebook environment for notebooks 1 - 4 you will then be using the Skillable VM for notebooks 5 - 7.

Let's look at each notebook and what you'll do:

| Notebook | Purpose | Duration |
|----------|---------|----------|
| 01_AzureML_Distillation | Generate training data using DeepSeek-V3 | 15 min |
| 02_AzureML_FineTuningAndConvertByMSOlive | Fine-tune Phi-4-mini with LoRA and optimize | 15 min |
| 03_AzureML_RuningByORTGenAI | Test model inference with ONNX Runtime | 10 min |
| 04_AzureML_RegisterToAzureML | Register model to Azure ML | 5 min |
| 05_Local_Download | Download model for local deployment | 5 min |
| 06_Local_Inference | Run inference locally | 10 min |
| 07_Local_Inference | Run inference locally with Foundry Local | 10 min |

Now you’re ready to work with the repository on your Azure ML Studio +++https://ml.azure.com+++
